# QA_Automation_Project

We are using Selenium, TestNG for Reporting, Java as a language to automate and Maven to manage all the dependencies throught the project, all of these resources are open source.

TestNG is better choice over JUnit, for complete comparison please visit : http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-vs-testng-comparison/


We are using combination of "Page Object Model" and "Data Driven" automation frameworks to automate Hello Bar.



This is the Package Representation of our Automation Framework:

1. PageObjects : This package will contain classes representing each page which need to be automated.

2. Helpers : This package will contain all the Helper classes which can be used throughout the automation project.

3. Tests : This package will contain all the test scripts(test cases) which we need to automate in different classes.
